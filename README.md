# snakeSDL2.exe | simple snake program made with SDL2 using C
- When I decided to make this game (for exercise), I challenged myself not to look up any information about the "snake" algorithm, and it took me 5 hours to find out the algorithm. 
- My code is not a good example because of redundant lines and declaring variables too much.
- Furthermore, I didn't explain anything in the source code because it's really hard to explain for me.
## To run the program properly :
- Download zip, extract it and run snakeSDL2.exe
### WARNING :
- ** It could be crashed if you won't deactivate the antivirus. (Since most antiviruses do not allow unknown programs to use GPU.)** 
- Run snakeSDL2.exe with "SDL2.dll", "SDL2_image.dll", "SDL2_mixer.dll" and "Effects" folder in the same location.

## To move the snake :

- UP : press W
- DOWN : press S
- LEFT : press A
- RIGHT : press D

## To exit :
- Press SPACE or ESC.
